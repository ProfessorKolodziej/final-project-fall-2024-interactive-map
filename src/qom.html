            <p>“In the 15th century AD, corpulent octagonal mausoleum structures of polyhedral roofs and trisected
                façade
                became the dominant style of Shiite mausoleums in Qom, whose example is the three tombs of the Green
                Garden
                [Baq-e Sabz], which was copied across the country during the later centuries. These types of tombs
                which,
                compare to the Seljuks towers, were wider in their floor level became simplified and quite common in
                Mazandaran during 15th century AD. There are shrines and tombs believed to belong to the predecessors
                and
                close relatives of Shiite Imams, such as Ma’soumeh’s [Imam Reza’s sister] shrine in Qom” (UNESCO).
