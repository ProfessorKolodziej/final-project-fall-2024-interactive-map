            <p>“The City of Yazd is located in the deserts of Iran close to the Spice and Silk Roads. It is a living
                testimony to intelligent use of limited available resources in the desert for survival. Water is brought
                to
                the city by the qanat system. Each district of the city is built on a qanat and has a communal centre.
                Buildings are built of earth. The use of earth in buildings includes walls, and roofs by the
                construction of
                vaults and domes. Houses are built with courtyards below ground level, serving underground areas.
                Wind-catchers, courtyards, and thick earthen walls create a pleasant microclimate. Besides creating
                pleasant
                micro-climate, it uses minimum amounts of materials, which provides inspiration for new architecture
                facing
                the sustainability challenges today.” (UNESCO).
