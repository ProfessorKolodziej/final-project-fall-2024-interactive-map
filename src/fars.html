            <p>“The eight archaeological sites situated in three geographical areas in the southeast of Fars Province:
                Firuzabad, Bishapur and Sarvestan. The fortified structures, palaces and city plans date back to the
                earliest and latest times of the Sassanian Empire, which stretched across the region from 224 to 658 CE.
                Among these sites is the capital built by the founder of the dynasty, Ardashir Papakan, as well as a
                city
                and architectural structures of his successor, Shapur I. The archaeological landscape reflects the
                optimized
                utilization of natural topography and bears witness to the influence of Achaemenid and Parthian cultural
                traditions and of Roman art, which had a significant impact on the architecture of the Islamic era”
                (UNESCO).
