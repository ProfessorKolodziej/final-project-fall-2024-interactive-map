            <p>“The Meidan Emam is a public urban square in the centre of Esfahan, a city located on the main
                north-south
                and east-west routes crossing central Iran. It is one of the largest city squares in the world and an
                outstanding example of Iranian and Islamic architecture. Built by the Safavid shah Abbas I in the early
                17th
                century, the square is bordered by two-storey arcades and anchored on each side by four magnificent
                buildings: to the east, the Sheikh Lotfallah Mosque; to the west, the pavilion of Ali Qapu; to the
                north,
                the portico of Qeyssariyeh; and to the south, the celebrated Royal Mosque. A homogenous urban ensemble
                built
                according to a unique, coherent, and harmonious plan, the Meidan Emam was the heart of the Safavid
                capital
                and is an exceptional urban realisation” (UNESCO).
