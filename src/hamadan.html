            based on agriculture and exports, especially garlic and grapes.As a sustainable green city, Hamedan believes
            that expanding the green economy with an emphasis on clean energy, waste management and public transport, is
            key to achieving SDGs 6 (clean water and sanitation), 8 (decent work and economic growth) and 11
            (sustainable cities and communities). By joining the GNLC, the city intends not only to promote sustainable
            development, but also to improve urban management, individual and social empowerment, economic development
            and prosperity” (UNESCO).
