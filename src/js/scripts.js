// This is where you should write all JavaScript
// for your project. Remember a few things as you start!
// - Use let or const for all variables
// - Do not use jQuery - use JavaScript instead
// - Do not use onclick - use addEventListener instead
// - Run npm run test regularly to check autograding
// - You'll need to link this file to your HTML :)

// Test to make sure my JS was connected to my HTML

console.log("Hello from Ariana!");

// Used ChatGPT to help me create a clickable button in HTML and JS

document.getElementById("myButton").addEventListener("click", function () {
});
